This project is all about making it easier for users to explore and manage a glossary of terms. The system allows users to look up words, get brief summaries, save words they're interested in, and even remove words from their saved list if they change their mind. It uses the Wikipedia API to provide accurate and detailed word summaries and relies on an SQLite database to keep everything organized. Whether you're diving into a new topic or just want to keep track of important terms, this system has you covered.
